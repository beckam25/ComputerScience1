"""
This program contains a function that
determines whether or not it is possible
to take a string (of lowercase English letters),
and without changing the relative order or the
characters in the string, partition the characters
into two substrings that are each in alphabetical
order.

For example, given the original string: "chbke",
it is possible to partition the characters as desired:
"chk" and "be".  Each substring
is in alphabetical order, and the characters are in
the same relative order as the original string (e.g. 'k'
comes after 'c' in substring 1, so it must also have been
in that order in the original string).

As another example, the original string: "gjba"
can not be split is desired.

Duplicate characters are allowed, and are considered
to be in alphabetical order.  For example, the original
string: "fmcmh" can be split into "fmm" and "ch".

It has bug(s).

There are no tests (yet).

Your job is to
1) include in this program a sufficient
suite of pass/fail tests to thoroughly
test the function and expose all error(s).

2) Generate a screenshot that
demonstrates your use of a debugger
to step through the function. Specifically it should
illustrates the execution point of a test at
which the function makes (or is about to make)
a mistake.

3) fix the code and document your fix(es).
Include additional tests if you feel it
necessary to thoroughly test the function.

You will submit your updated version of this
file (along with a separate document containing
the screenshot and answered questions).
